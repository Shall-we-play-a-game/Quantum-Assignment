# React JS and Node JS Login/Register Project

Welcome to the React JS and Node JS Login/Register Project! This project is a simple implementation of a login and registration system built with React JS for the frontend and Node JS for the backend. It also includes a protected dashboard route.

   ```

3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   cd client && npm install
   cd ../server && npm install
   ```

4. Start the frontend and backend servers:
   ```bash
   # In the client directory
   npm start

- **Session Management**: User sessions are managed securely to maintain login state.

## Technologies Used

- **React JS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node JS**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine for building scalable network applications.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node JS web application framework.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user information.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
